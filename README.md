## Development

### Requirement for Linux only

We use the package [keytar](http://atom.github.io/node-keytar/) to handle storage of encrypted settings and credentials in your system's keychain.
Currently, this library uses `libsecret` on Linux platform, so you may need to install it before running `npm ci`:
* Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev
* Red Hat-based: sudo yum install libsecret-devel
* Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S libsecret

### Running
```
npm ci
npm start
```

### Creating an executable
```
npm run make
```
