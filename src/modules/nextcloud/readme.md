# Nextcloud Module

Tested with Nextcloud 16, 17 and 18.

You need to install this [Quest-nextcloud](https://github.com/antitoine/Quest-nextcloud) application on your Nextcloud Server, in order to make the connection between nextcloud and Quest.

## Authentication

For Nextcloud versions >= 17, you can use the "Sign In" process directly in Quest. Thus, an application password will be generated for Quest only.

For Nextcloud versions < 17, you need to use the basic authentication with your credentials.
